# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a JS Tic-Tac-Toe AI that I made for fun. 
I wanted it to look fancy so I made the UI in HTML+CSS and the logic in JS.
I also set it up to work with express so it can be served on the web, and added a session variable to keep track of the game state even if the tab is closed or the page is refreshed.
Furthermore, the AI works very well. It can block common strategies/combos and knows how to make it's own. I haven't been able to beat it any way I try, so I believe it's good enough to always tie or win, and never lose.
